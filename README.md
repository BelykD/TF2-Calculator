TF2 Calculator is a simple Chrome Extension I made for the 2007 multiplayer first-person shooter game: 'Team Fortress 2'. Within the game there is a type of economy and "currency" used which is comprised of scrap, reclaimed, refined, and keys. Three scrap creates a reclaimed, and three reclaimed creates a refined. The issue this extensions tackles is the metal conversion for keys as keys can cost many refined making, for example, a calculation of 3.4 keys a difficult concept to tackle. This Chrome Extension takes two inputs: "Refined Price", and "Key Amount", using these numbers it calculates the total, as well as the break down of refined, reclaimed, and scrap metals. To accomplish the break down of metals, the JavaScript functions rounds to multiples of 11, where 11 would equal one scrap, 22 would equal two scrap, and 33 would then make a reclaimed. For example, given the total of 80.50, the function would output: 80 refined, 1 reclaimed, and 2 scrap as it would interpret it as 80.55.
